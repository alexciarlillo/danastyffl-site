## About

A Laravel & VueJS application that acts as a landing page for a fantasy league hosted on MFL. Uses the MFL API to fetch team standings by year, and other dynasty relevant information. Uses a custom auth provider which authenticates users against the MFL site, allowing the application to initiate actions on the user's behalf.

## TODO

* Add year selector
* Link to player rosters
* Ability to initiate trades
* Team profiles
  * Some information only viewable by logged in users of the league
